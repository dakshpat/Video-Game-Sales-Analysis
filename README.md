**Video Game Sales Analysis**

Project Description:

This project was an analysis on video game sales during their year of release in different regions from 1980 to 2020. The data was sourced from a public site: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales). I performed a series of queries to analyze the data using pandasql (see below). I then created interactive data visualizations with Tableau Software linked here: Tableau Data Visualizations.

Dashboard key metrics:
*   Video game sales performance during release year
*   Total sales count and percentage for each region
*   Yearly sales from 1980 - 2020
*   Sales for top 5 platforms, genres, and publishers
*   Filters for year, platform, genre, and publisher
